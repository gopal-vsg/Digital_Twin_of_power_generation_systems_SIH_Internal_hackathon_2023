Developing a comprehensive understanding of practical power generation systems is a complex and critical endeavor in the realm of modern engineering. However, the integration of machine learning techniques has ushered in a new era of innovation, allowing us to emulate and analyze the intricate behaviors of these systems in a simulated environment. This paradigm shift not only offers a nuanced perspective on system dynamics but also provides an effective means of identifying and addressing anomalies that may arise during operation.

The crux of this approach lies in the utilization of datasets derived from real-world power generation systems for training our machine learning models. These datasets encapsulate a wealth of information, encompassing various operating conditions, system responses, and potential deviations from the norm. Through a meticulous process of model training, the machine learning algorithm learns to capture the underlying patterns and intricacies inherent in the functioning of
